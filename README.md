TopHat Alternative

A website based off of tophat. Our website uses python's flask to route the different pages and sqlalchemy (SQLLite) to store all necessary data into our database.

Once a user reaches our index page ("/") the user can sign up (and specify if the user is an instructor or student) or login to an existing account (with the preferences already predetermined). 

Project requirements:
- User accounts
- User data - (Courses)
- (Websockets) Questions

Project imports:
- Flask==2.1.1
- Flask-SQLAlchemy==2.5.1
- Flask-SocketIO==6.1.1
- Werkzeug==2.0.3
